Overrding (Polymorphism)  -> Late Binding -> happens between two classes which is parent and child 

class Vehicle {
	move();
}

class Car extends Vehicle{
	move(); 
}

Inheritence - IS A
  
  
1) Garbage Collector 
	deamon -> background processes -> 
		you can all or leave the JVM to call. 
		
2) Overloading 
3) Static and Instance
	static variable/method are avaible even before the object 
		is created 
4) Interface 
		// this is not allowed 
	class MyClass extends YourClass extends SomeOtherClass {
	}
	
	in java a class can extends only 1 class 
	
	Interfaces are used in java majorly to work with multiple inheritence 
	
	
	// interfaces are 100% abstract 
	// they can have only defn 
	// interfaces cannot be used to create an object 
	// since the method is abstract, you cannot create
	// an object of Interface 
	
	interface IMyInterface {
		public static final int x; 
		hi();
	}
	
	// valid 
	class MyClass implements IMyInterface{
	// you have to implement all the methods which are 
	// there in the IMyInterface
	}
	
	 i) The class does not extends the Interface instead 
		 they implements
	 ii) The interface extends one more more interface(s) 
			interface i1 extends i2, i3, i4{}
     iii) The interface neither extends nor implements the 
			class 
	  iv) the class can extends only 1 class 
	   v) class which can extends only 1 class, but 
			it can also implement multiple interface
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
5) “HAS A” ->

	// USA -> India 
	class Employee{
		private int empId; 
		private Name name; 
		private double empIncome; 
		// Getters and setters 
	}
	
	class Customer {
		private int custId; 
		private Name name; 
		private double custIncome; 
	}
	
	
	class Name {
		private String firstName; 
		private String lastName; 
		private String middleName; 
	}
